# JS Fun in the Library

## Overview & Goals
For this solo project, I will focus on demonstrating my knowledge and comprehension of
JS primitives and their appropriate use and assignments. I will also demonstrate how to utilize arrays and objects.

## Iteration Schedule

### 0: Practice Variables, Primitives, Functions, Arrays, and Objects
  - I completed the brief warmup exercises in the warmup folder on May 6 at 5:30 pm.

### 1: Complete the book tests
  - I completed the book test on May 6 at 6:30 pm.

### 2: Complete the shelf tests
  - I completed the shelf test on May 6 at 11:30 pm.
  - I pushed two commits, one was after refactor review. 

### 3: Complete the library tests
  - Unskip the first test in `test/library-test.js`, and get to work passing the tests
  - Run `npm test test/library-test.js`  
  - Before moving on to the next iteration, take time to refactor your
    solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem? Is there a
    different way you could make the tests pass?  

### 4: Complete the Librarian tests
  - Unskip the first test in `test/Librarian-test.js`, and get to work passing the tests
  - Run `npm test test/Librarian-test.js`  
  - Take time to refactor your solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem?
    Is there a different way you could make the tests pass?
