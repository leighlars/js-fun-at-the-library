## Overview & Goals
For this solo project, I will focus on demonstrating my knowledge and comprehension of JS primitives and their appropriate use and assignments. I will also demonstrate how to utilize arrays and objects.

## Tools Used
I utilized my Turing lesson plans, MDN, and two alumni Ryan Barnett & Ricardo Viera.

## Notes
  - I created a page in the src folder called "mess-around". It is a space for the ugly pseudo code, notes, and alternative code solutions
